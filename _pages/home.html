    <p> Hi, my name is Khaled — a Software QA Engineer with a strong track record of ensuring product quality and reliability across diverse industries. </p>
    <p> Over the years, I’ve gained comprehensive experience of multiple phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) — from requirements analysis 
and design through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. </p>
    <p> As a Senior QA, I actively contribute not only during the testing phase but also from the early stages of the SDLC to ensure quality is built into 
the product from the start. </p>
    <p> I’m experienced in aligning QA processes with Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and other best-practice methodologies, ensuring 
continuous integration, efficient test coverage, and clear communication across development and product teams. </p>
    <p> I’m comfortable analyzing requirements for testability, identifying risks early, supporting automation strategy, and contributing to release 
planning and retrospectives. </p>
    <p> My approach to SDLC is holistic — I see quality as a shared responsibility across all stages, not just at the end of 
the cycle. </p>
    <p> I also bring experience as a Presales Engineer, bridging the gap between technical solutions and client needs. In this role, I collaborated 
closely with sales and product teams to understand customer requirements, design tailored solution demonstrations, and present the technical value 
of products effectively. </p>
    <p> I was responsible for preparing technical proposals, conducting proof-of-concepts, and ensuring that proposed solutions aligned with both business objectives and technical feasibility. </p>
    <p> This experience strengthened my communication, presentation, and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to translate complex technical concepts into clear, value-driven discussions with clients. </p>
